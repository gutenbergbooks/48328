<h2>TO THE MEDICAL PROFESSION.</h2>


<p>The physiological studies, researches, designs, etc., are
made at our laboratory, Neuilly s/Seine, France, where, in
connection with hot-houses, the study and cultivation of
the Coca plant is carried on under my personal supervision,
and am pleased to say have succeeded in producing large
quantities of Coca plants, in all stages of growth and of various
species, under all conditions of planting, by seeds,
transplantation and grafting, all results being carefully
watched and recorded.</p>

<p>I hereby extend the most cordial invitation to the medical
profession and shall be happy to receive the visit of physicians
who may be interested in the subject.</p>

Each</span> race has its fashions and fancies. The
Indian munches the betel; the Chinaman
woos with passion the brutalizing intoxication
of opium; the European occupies his
idle hours or employs his leisure ones in smoking,
chewing or snuffing tobacco. Guided by a happier
instinct, the native of South America has adopted
Coca. When young, he robs his father of it; later
on, he devotes his first savings to its purchase.
Without it he would fear vertigo on the summit of
the Andes, and weaken at his severe labor in the
mines. It is with him everywhere; even in his
sleep he keeps his precious quid in his mouth.</p>

<p>But should Coca be regarded merely as a masticatory?
And must we accept as irrevocable the decision
of certain therapeutists: "Cocaine, worthless; Coca,
superfluous drug"?<a name="Anchor_1" id="Anchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">[1]</a></p>

<p>For several years laryngologists such as: Fauvel,
of France; Morell Mackenzie and Lennox Browne, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>England; and Elsberg, of America, had undertaken
the defense of Coca.</p>

<p>Under such patronage Coca and its preparations were
not slow in becoming popular.</p>

<p>Charles Fauvel was the first to make use of it as a
general tonic, having a special action on the larynx;
and to make known its anæsthetic and analgesic qualities.</p>

<p>Coca was further recommended, as it were empirically,
against stomatitis, gingivitis, gastric disturbances,
and phthisis (Rabuteau), <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Eléments de thérapeutique
et de pharmacologie</cite>.</p>

<p>Although striking effects were obtained from this
valuable medicine, its full worth was yet unknown
and there was diversity of opinion as to its mode of
action, until the communications of Köller, of Vienna,
on Coca and Cocaine, appeared in 1884.</p>

<p>These interesting publications led to such general
discussion among medical men, that nearly every one
eagerly followed the work, and watched the splendid
results obtained by the Viennese physician (now Professor
of Ophthalmology in New York Polyclinic).</p>

<p>It is found that studies made of the active principles
of Coca have entirely corroborated our previsions,
and probably no subject has received greater
attention than have the virtues of this little Peruvian
shrub, formerly looked upon in Europe with so much
indifference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>The scientific study of the principles of Coca may be
considered as completed; and we believe that the time
has arrived in which to summarize data regarding
this therapeutic agent, so that the employment of our
preparations may be based on positive clinical experience.</p>

<p>The aim of this modest work is to offer to the medical
profession a short account of the history of Coca,
and of the investigations which it has called forth up
to the present day.</p>

<p>We propose to divide our subject into five parts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap lowercase">1ST.</span> We will describe the botanical character of
Coca, and also speak of its culture and the mode of
gathering it.</p>

competent physicians in Europe and America.</p>

Coca</span> is indigenous to South America. The different
botanists disagree as to which exact family it
should be assigned. Linnæus, De Candolle,
Payer, Raymundi of Lima, Huntk, and others,
place it in the family of the <i>Erythroxyleæ</i>, of which there
exists but one genus, the <i>Erythroxylon</i>, while Jussien adopts
another classification and places it in the family of the
<i>Malpighiaceæ</i> (<i>genus Sethia</i>). Lamarck, on the contrary, believes
that this plant should be classed among the family
of Nerprem (Rhamneæ).</p>

<p><i>Erythroxylon Coca</i> is a shrub which reaches a height of
from six to nine feet and the stem is of about the thickness
of a finger. In our climate it cannot thrive except in a
hot-house, and there its height does not exceed one metre.</p>

<p>The root, rather thick, shows multiple and uniform
divisions; its trunk is covered with a ridged bark, rugged,
nearly always glabrous, and of a whitish color. Its boughs
and branches, rather numerous, are alternant, sometimes
covered with thorns when the plant is cultivated in a soil
which is not well adapted to it.</p>

<p>The leaves, which fall spontaneously at the end of each
season, are alternate, petiolate, with double intra-accillary
stipules at the base. In shape they are elliptical-lanceolate,
their size varying according to the nature of the plant or
of the soil in which it grows.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<p>The leaf of Coca gathered in Peru, of which we give
two figures of the natural size, is generally larger and
thicker than the leaf of the Bolivian Coca. It is also richer
in the alkaloid, consequently much more bitter.</p>

<p>The Coca leaf from Bolivia, smaller than the Peruvian
leaf, is as much esteemed as the latter, although it contains
less of the alkaloid. It possesses so exquisite and so soft
an aroma, indeed, that the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">coqueros</i> seek it in preference
to any other.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The Coca leaves of Brazil and Colombia are much smaller
than those of Peru and Bolivia. Their color is much paler.
Containing but traces of the alkaloid they are not bitter,
and possess a pleasant, but very volatile aroma.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>
<p>One of the most important characteristics of the Coca
leaf is the disposition of its nervures; parallel with the
midrib two longitudinal projections are to be seen, which,
starting from the base of the leaf, extend in a gentle curve
to its point.</p>

</div>

<p>The upper surface of these leaves is of a beautiful green
tint; the lower surface of a paler green, except, however,
near the midrib. At this point, there is a strip of green
darker than the rest, which becomes brown in the withered
leaves.</p>

<p>The flowers, small, regular and hermaphrodite, white or

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>little bunches of cyme at the axil of the leaves or bracts,
which take their place on certain branches. The disposition
into cymes is that most commonly met with. They
are supported by a slender pedicel, somewhat inflated at
the top, the length of which does not exceed one centimetre.</p>

<p>The sepals, joined at the base and lanceolated, are
of a green tint with a whitish top. The petals, half a
centimetre in length, pointed, concave inside and yellowish white,
exhale a rather pleasant odor. They are provided with an
exterior appendage, of the same color and of the same consistency,
surmounted on each side with an
ascending fimbriated leaf, irregularly triangular
in shape. The stamens, at first
joined in a tube for one-third of their
length, afterward separate into white subulated
strings, provided with an obtuse ovoid
anther which extends a little beyond the
petals. The ovary is ovoid in shape and
green in color, thickening at the top into
a yellowish glandular tissue. The style
which rises above it separates into three
diverging branches, provided with orbicular
papilliform bodies at their extremity,
obliquely inserted into the slender patina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p>The fruit is a drupe of an elongated ovoid form, being
a little more than a centimetre in length, of a reddish color
when fresh, and having a tender, thickish pulp inclosing a
seed. This seed shows longitudinal furrows and alternate
vertical projections which make its division irregularly
hexagonal. When the fruit is dried, the skin assumes
a brownish color, shrivels up and molds itself on the protuberances
and irregularities of the seed.</p>


<h3>CULTIVATION OF COCA.</h3>

<p><i>Erythroxylon Coca</i> appears to have come originally from
Peru, and from there its cultivation was carried into
Bolivia, Ecuador, New Grenada, and Brazil, in a word,
throughout the entire torrid zone of South America.</p>

<p>For some time, as a result of the extended consumption
of Coca and for a still stronger reason, now that the day
is at hand when the consumption of Coca will assume
greater proportions, numerous plantations of Coca trees
have been laid out in regions where that shrub was formerly
unknown. We take pleasure in recording that
these attempts have proved successful in the Antilles,
thanks to the disinterested sacrifices of our friend, Dr.
Bétancès. It is also with pleasure that we present anew
an interesting communication made by the learned doctor
to the "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Société d'Acclimatation de France</span>" as appeared in
the <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Revue Diplomatique</cite>, 17th of March, 1888.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 433px;"><a id="i_p014"></a>
<img src="images/i_p014.jpg" width="433" height="600" alt="BRANCH OF COCA. NATURAL SIZE." />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">BRANCH OF COCA. NATURAL SIZE.</p>

<p class="center">Sent by Monseigneur de Mereño, Archbishop of San Domingo,
to Dr. Bétancès, Paris.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>"Dr. Bétancès has succeeded in acclimatizing Coca in
the Antilles. At considerable expense and after numerous
shipments of seeds and the transportation of plants (this
with the greatest difficulty) to Porto Rico and San Domingo,
Dr. Bétancès had the pleasure of receiving a fine branch
of Coca in full bloom, which was sent to him by Monseigneur
Mereño, Archbishop of San Domingo. This twig,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a><br /><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>which the members of the Society were enabled to examine,
excited the most lively curiosity and won the commendation
of M. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. It was raised
from a plant which had been only eighteen months under
cultivation."</p>

<p>"In Porto Rico the plant reaches a greater height than
in Peru.</p>

<p>"A box filled with beautiful leaves has also been received
by Dr. Bétancès and forwarded to Mr. Mariani. This also
came from Monseigneur Mereño.</p>

<p>"It is therefore evident that the plant can be cultivated
in the Antilles and that it may become a source of wealth
to that country."</p>

<p>Plantations like this would probably thrive in Corsica or
Algeria, countries where the temperature at certain points
is somewhat analogous to that of the tropics.</p>

<p>It is a fact that this shrub does not attain its complete development
except in countries where the mean temperature
is from fifteen to eighteen degrees centigrade.</p>

<p>But heat does not suffice; great humidity is also necessary
to Coca. Therefore it is met with principally on the
sides of hills and at the bottom of wooded valleys which
abound on both sides of the Cordillieras. Unfortunately,
these regions are rather distant from the coast and they
are, furthermore, devoid of easy means of communication;
it is above all to this particular cause, the difficulty of
transportation, that we must attribute the relatively high
price of Coca leaves.</p>

<p>The cultivation of Coca trees is begun by sowing the
seed in beds called <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Almazigos</i>. As soon as the plant appears
it is protected from the heat of the sun by means
of screens and matting; when it reaches a height of from
40 to 50 centimetres, it is transferred to furrows 18 centimetres
in length by 7 in depth, care being taken that each

<p>During the first year maize is sown in the interspaces,
rapidly overreaching the shrub, and taking the place of
the screens and mats.</p>

<p>The growth of the shrub is rather rapid, reaching its
full height in about five years. But the time when it
becomes productive precedes that at which it attains its
complete height by about 3&frac12; years after being planted.
After that, when the season has
been especially damp, it yields as
often as four times a year.</p>

<p>Attempts have been made to acclimatize
it in Europe, but so far
without success. As early as 1869
the cultivation of it was tried in
the Botanical Garden of Hyères,
but no satisfactory result was obtained.
We presented, in 1872,
two samples to the appreciative
and learned director of the Garden
of Acclimatization of Paris, M.
Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, and notwithstanding
all the care taken of
the young plants, they failed to
reach their full growth. Several
frail Coca plants may be seen in
the conservatories of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jardin
des Plantes de Paris</i>, in the Botanical
Gardens of London, of Brussels,
etc., likewise at several great
horticulturists' of Gand, notably
Van Houten's. As may be seen by the large colored engraving<a name="Anchor_2" id="Anchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2.">[2]</a>
and by the branch engraved above, these
specimens of <i>Erythroxylon Coca</i> are very far from giving an
idea of the plant growing in the open air, in a soil and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>under a temperature that are favorable to its development,
as shown by the leaves of Peruvian Coca, illustrated above,
and which come from one of the newest <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">haciendas</i> of Santa-Anna,
belonging to M. M.-P. Concha, bordering on the
territory of a savage tribe of Antis or Campas, on the Urubanba
river, which joins the Amazon in latitude 12° S.,
longitude 75° W.</p>


<h3>GATHERING OF COCA.</h3>

<p>The plant begins to yield when it is about a year and a
half old.</p>

<p>The leaf is the only part of the plant used.</p>

<p>It should be gathered in dry weather; this is entrusted
generally to women, and simply consists in plucking each
leaf with the fingers.</p>

<p>The leaves are received into aprons, carefully carried
under sheds, to shelter them from the rain and dampness,
dried, and then packed.</p>

<p>We quote from the <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Voyage dans la région du Titicaca</cite>, by
Paul Marcoy, the following passage ("Tour of the World,"
May, 1877): "Of all the valleys of the Carabaya group,
Ituata is the one where Coca is cultivated on the largest
scale. They were then at the height of the work, peons
and peonnes were following each other through the plantations
of the shrub, so dear to the natives that a decree
of 1825 placed it in the crown of the arms of Peru, alongside
of the vicunia and cornucopia, or horn-of-plenty.
Men and women carried a cloth slung across the shoulders
in which were placed the leaves, as they gathered them
one by one. These leaves, spread out on large awnings,
were exposed to the sun for two or three days, then packed
up in bags of about one metre in size, and sent off to all
parts of the territory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"This gathering of the Coca is just such an occasion for
rejoicing for the natives of the valleys, as reaping-time and
harvests are for our peasants. On the day when the
gathering of the leaves is finished both sexes that have
taken part in the work assemble and celebrate, in dances
and libations, the pleasure they experience in having
finished their labors."</p>

<p>In 1851, the annual production of Bolivia was estimated
to be more than 400,000 certos (600,000 kilogrammes) of
Coca leaves, of which three-quarters came from the province
of Yungas.</p>

Coca</span> has been known from time immemorial in
South America. At the time when Pizarro
landed on the Peruvian coast, the leaf of Coca
was held in great esteem among the natives; it
was considered to be a divine plant, a living representation
of the Deity, a fetish of wonderful and supernatural qualities,
and the fields where it grew were reverenced as sanctuaries.
Not everybody was allowed to make use of it;
its use was the privilege of the nobles and of the priests,
and among the greatest rewards that the sovereign could
give his subjects, the privilege of chewing Coca leaves was
most highly esteemed.</p>

<p>However strange such a superstition may appear, it is
indisputable, and all authors that have published the account
of the conquest of the Indies corroborate it. It will
suffice for us to quote the testimony of Joseph Acosta, who
says in every letter, of his natural and moral history of the
Indies, of the East as well as of the West, published in
1653:</p>

<p>"The Indians esteem it highly, and during the reign of
the Incas, the common people were not allowed to use Coca
without the permission of the Governor."</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">NATIVES OF COLOMBIA CHEWING COCA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The disappearance of the empire of the Incas, far from
diminishing the importance of Coca, on the contrary gave
a very much greater scope to its popularity. The natives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>profited by their freedom from the restrictions imposed
by the native rulers in regard to the consumption of Coca,
and soon the use of this leaf became so common that it
has been compared by every one interested in the question
to the use of tobacco by us; and, as it has justly been
added, without its objections. There is no more likelihood
of seeing a smoker embark without his tobacco than
an Indian begin work or undertake a journey unless his
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">chuspa</i> (pouch) is full of Coca leaves. Three or four times
a day he sits down, takes some leaves, puts them one by
one into his mouth and rolls them into an <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">aculio</i> (quid),
adding a little <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">llipta</i> (lime), which he takes from his ever-present
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">poporo</i>. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">poporo</i> is a little gourd, bored at the
mouth on the upper part, in which the Indian keeps his
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">llipta</i>. This <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">llipta</i> is a white powder composed of ashes of
vegetables and of calcined shells pulverized, with which the
consumers of Coca have been accustomed, from the most
remote times, to season their quid. It is, really, an alkaline
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>substance intended to isolate the different principles of the
leaf and to make the action of the Coca more prompt.</p>

<p>Among those inhabitants of South America, with whom
the use of Coca did not extend to the lower classes until after
the reign of the Incas, and who reserved for themselves, as
we have seen, the right of chewing the Coca leaves, the consumption
of Coca by children is strictly prohibited. They
do not indulge in this luxury except in secret, and it appears
to them all the sweeter because it is forbidden. But
nearly always their breath, charged with the tell-tale odor
of Coca, betrays them on approaching their parents, and
the latter make them pay for the pleasure which they have
stolen, and to which they are not entitled until they are of
age, with very severe punishment. Only when they have
grown up will they be allowed to chew Coca and to carry
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">poporo</i>, which they do not relinquish even in the grave.</p>

<p>On coming of age the young Indian is consigned to an
old woman, who keeps him a few hours in her hut to initiate
him in the mysteries of man's estate.</p>

<p>After this ceremony she gives him the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">chuspa</i> (Coca
pouch), invests him with the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">poporo</i> and consecrates him
a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">coquero</i>. One should see with what pride the young
Indian leaves the threshold of the sacred cabin, which he
entered as a child scarcely a few hours before and from
which he departs a man, that is to say, carrying the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">chuspa</i>
and the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">poporo</i>, and able to chew with impunity, before the
old people, this precious leaf which had been forbidden
him until then.</p>

<p>No happiness is comparable to his! See with what an
important air he draws forth the Coca leaves from his
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">chuspa</i>, as he rolls them in his fingers to make a large
quid of them, which he carries to his mouth, moistens
delightingly with saliva, and places under his jaws and
against his cheeks. He is seen holding carefully in his
right hand the little stick, the extremity of which he
is going to moisten by putting it into his mouth, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>which he will dip into the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">poporo</i> in order that the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">llipta</i>
may adhere to its moistened part.</p>

<p>He carefully carries the part of his little stick covered
with <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">llipta</i> to his quid, and thus performs the operation
of mixing the alkaline powder with the masticated leaf.
It is at this moment that the quid of Coca affords the young
adult the most delightful sensation. His jaws munch it
slowly, his tongue collects and rolls it up against the left
cheek, all the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">papillæ</i> of his mouth refresh themselves
deliciously with the soothing and aromatic juices of the
precious leaf, and by the slow and measured motions of
deglutition, he carries with delight the precious juice into
the pharynx and thence to the stomach. While he is accomplishing
this important operation, his eyes swim with
beatitude, over his entire countenance is diffused an expression
of content and unutterable joy, and his right hand
slowly turns the little stick around the upper part of the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">poporo</i>, where are deposited little by little the particles of
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">llipta</i> and masticated Coca, which on leaving his mouth
adhere to its extremity.</p>

<p>The only occupation of the first days of the adult is
the much-loved quid of Coca and the encrusting of his
gourd, which we cannot do better than compare to the
coating of the pipe, with this difference that our confirmed
smokers blacken hundreds of their pipes during their
existence, while the Indian encrusts only one gourd in his
whole life; so that by the thickness of the crust formed
around a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">poporo</i>, it is possible to judge the age of its owner.
This crust, which hardly ever exceeds the thickness of a
ring on the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">poporo</i> of a young Indian, ends by reaching the
dimension of the pileus of a large mushroom on the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">poporo</i>
of an old man.</p>

<p>The crust is produced by the particles of Coca and <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">llipta</i>
mixed with saliva which are deposited little by little about
the mouth of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">poporo</i> by smearing with the stick.</p>

<p>These deposits are brought about in an almost imperceptible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>manner. It is only after some months that the
surface of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">poporo</i>, on which the chewer continually
turns the little stick, becomes covered with a hardly perceptible
layer of calcareous substance; at the end of two or
three years the superimposed layers form a ring which
grows larger from year to year, and which finally attains
the thickness we have spoken of above.</p>

<div class="caption center">3. Poporo of an old man.</div></div>

<p>As we have said before, the Indian never parts with his
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">poporo</i>, let him be awake or asleep, at home or on his travels,
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">poporo</i> is always attached to his belt. An Indian would
part with all he holds most dear in the world, all, except
his <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">poporo</i>.</p>

<p>We have the rare and good fortune to possess a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">poporo</i>,
of which we give a picture (fig. 3). It is, we believe,
the only specimen existing in Europe. We owe it to the
kindness of M. Gauguet, who has made numerous voyages
to Colombia, where he has been able to establish so much
sympathy among the natives that one of their old chiefs,
who was specially indebted, did not fear to depart from all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>custom and to incur the contempt of his companions, by
offering him, as a pledge of friendship, the object to which
he attached the greatest value&mdash;his <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">poporo</i>!<a name="Anchor_3" id="Anchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3.">[3]</a></p>

<p>Thus the great importance that an Indian attaches to
Coca is easily shown. It should be recognized, moreover,
that the first conquerors of the country did not fail to
countenance the passion of the vanquished for the national
plant. In fact, they quickly recognized that the habit of
consuming Coca might become an excellent source of
revenue; and Garcillasco de la Véga, a half-breed of the
first generation, tells us that in his time a part of the impost
was paid to the conqueror in the form of Coca leaves.
The benefits which were derived from the traffic in this
plant were such that at a certain time the revenues of the
bishop and of the canons of the cathedral of Cuzco came
from the tithe on these leaves.</p>

<p>There was, moreover, another object in favoring the use
of Coca among the Indians. The latter were treated, as
is known, as if they were beasts of burden, and their
oppressors were not slow to recognize the fact that they
furnished much better labor when they consumed Coca.</p>

<p>We shall see, further on, that the recognition of this fact,
the correctness of which cannot be disputed, and which
served to excite the rapacity of the conquering savages of
that time, has become to-day the means of furnishing one
of the most valuable aids to contemporary therapeutics.</p>

<p>The particular favor in which the plant was held in the
beginning of the conquest, was destined to suffer some
disturbance. In the seventeenth century, for example,
the religious quibbles regaining the ascendancy in public
affairs, some sedate theologians pretended that Coca
was an aliment, and that under this name the use of it
should be prohibited to young people and before the communion.
The question was vigorously contested, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>there is no doubt that the consumption of Coca would have
sustained a very decided blow had not Prince don Alonzo
de la Pina Montenegro declared that the plant contained
no alimentary principle. This point we shall presently
consider from a scientific point of view.</p>

<p>Although the inhabitants of the Indies attach so much
importance to the use of Coca, this product can not be acclimatized
in our hemisphere, and our fathers who took up
the use of tobacco with so much eagerness remained indifferent
to Coca. Perhaps this indifference should be attributed
to the exaggerations of the first importers, who coming
to Europe still imbued with the legends gathered in
the New World ascribed supernatural qualities to the new
plant. The exaggeration of these statements soon became
apparent. From this it was only a step to a denial even of
its existence. And thus, for more than two centuries, we
were deprived of the advantages to be derived from the
judicious use of the plant.</p>

<p>It should not be believed, however, that the various
writers during these two centuries remained entirely silent
regarding Coca. The study of the properties of the plant
was still a field of research for a number of learned men,
small, it is true, but they well knew that side by side with
fiction, which they rejected, there was a reality that it were
better to accept.</p>

<p>We further observe, that Claude Duret, a magistrate of
Moulins, who wrote a book, printed in 1605, on <cite>The Marvellous
and Wonderful Plants in Nature</cite>, mentions Coca as
one of the most worthy to figure in his colleccion.</p>

<p>Nicholas Monardes in the <cite>General History of Plants</cite>, published
in Lyons in 1653, calls attention likewise to the
properties of Coca.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century, <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">l'abbé</span> Longuerue, who was a
theologian, an historian, and a philologist, speaking of the
Spanish colonies in South America, says, in regard to the
mines explored in Peru: "The negroes can not work in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>the mines, they all die. Hardly any but the natives are
able to endure this labor, and then it is necessary to relieve
them frequently and that they should chew Coca,
without which the quicksilver vapors would kill them."</p>

<p>Linnæus says that Coca possesses: "the penetrating
aroma of vegetable stimulants, the astricting and fortifying
virtues of an astringent, the antispasmodic qualities of
bitters, and the mucilaginous nutritive properties of analeptics
or of alimentary plants. This leaf," he continues,
"exhibits with energy its action on all parts of the animal
economy: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Olido in nervos, sapido in fibras utroque in
fluido</i>."</p>

<p>Father don Antonio Julian wrote: "This plant is a
preventive against many diseases, a restorative of lost
strength, and is capable of prolonging human life. It is
sincerely to be regretted that so many poor families do not
possess this preventive of hunger and thirst; that so many
employees and laborers should be deprived of this means
of maintaining their strength in the midst of continuous
toil; that so many old and young men engaged in the
arduous task of study and the accomplishment of their
undertakings are unable to derive the beneficial results of
this plant to guard against the exhaustion of the vital
spirits, debility of the brain, and weakness of the stomach,
which are frequent results of continuous study."</p>

<p>Böerhaave (<cite>Inst. phys.</cite> § 68), states that: "the saliva charged
with all the bitter and mucilaginous principles of Coca carries
to the stomach, in addition to vital strength, a veritable
nutritive which, digested and converted into an
abundant and nutritious chyle, enters into the circulation
and is converted into the material necessary to sustain the
human economy."</p>

<p>We shall not stop to quote the different writings of
observers who have interested themselves in Coca. It
may be inferred from the preceding statements that Coca
possesses this particular character, viz., of enabling those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>who make use of it to withstand the greatest fatigue. Men
employed in hard work in mines, couriers obliged to traverse
mountainous countries difficult of travel without being
able to take much rest, in a word, persons subject to
overwork in every way, all agree in recognizing the
strengthening and nerve-fortifying action of Coca. It
supports them, economizes their forces, prevents their
succumbing to lassitude&mdash;in short, augments their vitality.</p>

<p>When the Indian has a good supply of Coca he undertakes,
without the slightest fear, the most difficult and
longest voyages, even into fever-stricken countries.</p>

<p>When he passes before an <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">apachecta</i> (a quadrangular
mound which the natives raise on the sides of the roads
at certain points for a halting-place), the Indian divests
himself of his wraps, takes his quid of Coca from his
mouth, always after having previously exhausted it, and,
in order to draw down upon it the blessing of Pachacamac,
their sovereign master of the world, he throws it against
the consecrated hillock. Thus, that which particularly characterizes
these kinds of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tumuli</i> are the green splashes of
Coca with which they are literally covered.</p>

<p>The name of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">coqueros</i> is given to the chewers of Coca. It
seems that this plant procured for them dreams like those
to which hachisch gives rise.</p>

<p>In native therapeutics, this plant is used to dress ulcers
and all kinds of sores. The Indians also use it to combat
asthma, jaundice, colic, etc.</p>

<p>Coca is consumed chiefly in Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, and
Brazil. Since 1863&mdash;the time from which our first efforts to
popularize it date&mdash;its use has rapidly become general, and
it may be stated that to-day it is known and used in all
civilized countries.</p>

It</span> is to empiricism and that alone that we owe
our first knowledge of the physiological action
of Coca. There is nothing surprising in that,
for empiricism is nothing more, in reality, than
unconscious observation.</p>

<p>The Indians, who from time immemorial consumed so
great a quantity of Coca leaves, did not do so merely
from religious sentiment which deified the leaves of Coca,
they well knew that they would derive great benefit from
its use; they knew it only too well, since it is to that cause
that we must attribute the legendary accounts given by the
first authors who wrote on Coca.</p>

<p>This veneration for Coca arose, as we have seen, from
its wonderful qualities. There are indeed, in this direction,
some truly extraordinary accounts which should not be
dismissed without notice, as they are given in good faith.</p>

<p>Unanué, of Lima, relates that at the siege of La Paz,
Bolivia, in 1781, only those inhabitants who had taken
Coca were able to endure hunger and fatigue. Nearly all
of the soldiers perished, deprived, as they were of food
and overcome by forced marches, except those who had
taken the precaution to provide themselves with Coca
leaves.</p>

<p>It must not be believed that this prolonged fast, sustained
by the use of Coca, wastes the strength and is injurious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>to the appetite. Indeed, according to the statement
of all authors, the Indians who pass an entire day without
eating, notwithstanding the hardship of forced marches,
content themselves with chewing Coca leaves, and eat very
heartily in the evening.</p>

<p>"The Indians who accompanied me on my voyage," says
Weddel, "chewed Coca leaves all day, neither drinking,
eating, nor showing any signs of fatigue. But at evening
they replenished their stomachs like men who were completely
famished, and I can assure you that I have sometimes
seen them devour at one meal more aliment than I
could have consumed in two days." We will see, further
on, that it is in exciting the cerebro-medullary and nervous
muscular functions, in part, and partly in producing
a soothing effect on the mucous membrane of the stomach,
that Coca produces these wonderful results in the conservation
of energy without the tortures of hunger, notwithstanding
the deprivation of aliment.</p>

<p>After this abstract of the well-known and recognized
properties of Coca leaves, we will proceed to the medical
study undertaken regarding this subject.</p>

<p>In 1850 Niemann discovered the active principle of the
leaves of Coca, to which he gave the name of Cocaine,
though, in fact, the discovery of this alkaloid should be
attributed to Gardeke, who had separated it in 1855 under
the name of <i>Erythroxyline</i>.</p>

<p>The work of Demarle appeared in that same year, on
"The Coca of Peru"<a name="Anchor_4" id="Anchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 4.">[4]</a>, in which he pointed out certain properties
attributed by him to the alkaloid that the leaves of
the plant contained, and which he studied. He remarked,
among other things, the dilatation of the pupils, which he
had noticed in his own case after having taken a dose of
Coca; the absence of taste for a greater or less length of
time after crushing some leaves with his teeth and letting
them remain in the mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Mantegazza has studied the effect of Coca and, according
to this author, it acts as a stimulant on the nervous system,
the respiration, and the circulation.</p>

<p>A dose of fifteen to twenty grammes of Coca produces
an increase of the heart-beat, increasing pulse, and finally
a rise in temperature. Mantegazza observed on himself
that, under the influence of such a dose, his pulse
increased from 65 to 124. Moreno, who repeated the same
experiment, obtained similar results. The temperature
and respiration are increased in the same proportion as
the circulation.</p>

<p>The same dose, or even a weaker one, produces a remarkably
stimulating effect on the nervous system. It is from
this stimulating effect that Coca makes one more active
and vigorous and enables those to accomplish more work
who, without it, would soon be overcome with more or less
fatigue. The use of larger doses (60 grammes for example)
has caused intoxication, accompanied by sensation of
happiness, which makes everything appear under a favorable
aspect. Mantegazza, who experienced this intoxication,
describes his sensations in an animated style,
which recalls that of the Oriental legends: "Borne on
the wings of two Coca leaves, I flew about in the spaces
of 77,438 worlds, one more splendid than another. I
prefer a life of ten years with Coca to one of a hundred
thousand without it. It seemed to me that I was separated
from the whole world, and I beheld the strangest
images, most beautiful in color and in form that can be
imagined."</p>

<p>In 1868, Moreno y Maïz made some researches into the
physiological action of Cocaine, and explained them in an
interesting thesis which he read before the Faculty of
Paris<a name="Anchor_5" id="Anchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 5.">[5]</a>.</p>

<p>At about the same time, Lippmann, of Strasbourg, devoted
his labors to the same subject, but his investigations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>did not yield the same results. He says that he could not
establish the anæsthetic properties of the plant.<a name="Anchor_6" id="Anchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 6.">[6]</a></p>

<p>After Moreno y Maïz, Dr. Gazeau<a name="Anchor_7" id="Anchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 7.">[7]</a>, in 1870, studied the
stimulating effect of Coca on nutrition, and found that it
increased the pulse and respiration, assisted digestion, increased
urinary excretion, and strengthened the nervous
system. This author arrived at the conclusion that Coca
prolongs life and promotes muscular energy. He advises
its use, locally, for stomatitis, gingivitis, aphthous ulceration,
and generally for painful and difficult digestion,
gastric disturbance in phthisis, and also for obesity.</p>

<p>It was Charles Fauvel who first described the anæsthetizing
effect of Coca on the pharyngeal mucous membrane<a name="Anchor_8" id="Anchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 8.">[8]</a>.
Thanks to this circumstance, he has been able
to derive much benefit from the use of Coca in granular
pharyngitis which is generally unaffected by any other
kind of treatment.</p>

<p>Fauvel further showed that the stimulating effect which
Coca exercises on all the muscles of the economy, appears
to manifest itself specially on all the muscles of the larynx.
Hence his apt qualification of the drug, "a tensor <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>
of the vocal cords."</p>

<p>In 1880, Von Arep published the results of his physiological
researches with Cocaine. He spoke of its double
effect on the nervous extremities and on the central nervous
system.</p>

<p>We approach, on leaving this epoch, the really scientific
era, that is to say, that of physiological experiments.</p>

<p>All the experiments having been made with Cocaine,
we shall speak of it in the next chapter, which will be
devoted exclusively to the study of this alkaloid.</p>

<p>Before closing, we will mention that it has been claimed
frequently that Coca was aphrodisiac. The fact that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>Peruvian Venus was represented as holding in her hand a
leaf of Coca, was suggested as a proof in support of this
opinion. Dr. Unanué speaks of "certain <span xml:lang="es" lang="es">coqueros</span>, eighty
years of age and over, and yet capable of such prowess as
young men in the prime of life would be proud of."</p>

<p>Let us here add that the so-called unhappy consequences
of the abuse of Coca are really much more rare than those
produced even by tobacco, alcohol or opium.</p>

<p>The constant use of reasonable doses of Coca appears to
produce a diametrically opposite effect, and the authors,
who have had occasion to see a great number of Coca consumers,
report cases of astonishing longevity among the
Indian <span xml:lang="es" lang="es">coqueros</span> (Tschudy, Campbell, Mantegazza, Unanué).
They add that these instances are far from being exceptional.</p>


<h3>COCAINE.</h3>

<h4 title="I.&mdash;A CHEMICAL STUDY."><abbr title="one">I.</abbr>&mdash;A CHEMICAL STUDY.<a name="Anchor_9" id="Anchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 9.">[9]</a></h4>

<p>Cocaine is a crystallized alkaloid which Niemann, a
pupil of Prof. W&oelig;hler, succeeded in extracting, in 1859,
from some leaves of <i>Erythroxylon Coca</i> and to which he gave
the following formula:</p>

<p class="center">
C<sup>32</sup> H<sup>2</sup> O Az O<sup>2</sup><br />
</p>

<p>Before it was known to him, Wackenroder, Johnston, Gardeke
and Maclagan analyzed this plant without succeeding
in the isolation of its active principle.</p>

<p>Some important works undertaken on this subject by
Lassen, Humann and R. Pérey are also quoted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Properties.</em>&mdash;Cocaine is colorless, odorless, and bitter to
the taste. It crystallizes in the shape of oblique rhomboid
prisms of from four to six facets.</p>

<p>It is very soluble in water, less soluble in alcohol, and
absolutely insoluble in ether. It does not vaporize below
98°, but if the temperature is greatly increased it is decomposed.
It possesses a strongly alkaline reaction.</p>

<p>United with acids it forms salts which are very difficult
to crystallize.</p>

<p>Those which have been obtained from it are: the salicylate,
oxalate, hydrobromide, sulphate, acetate, and finally
the hydrochlorate, which forms an exception to the general
rule, and is obtained more easily in the crystalline form
than any other.</p>

<p>The solutions of the salts of Cocaine are precipitated by
the caustic alkalies, carbonate of sodium, carbonate of ammonium,
the alkaline bicarbonates, the bichloride of mercury,
the protochloride of tin, bichloride of platinum, and
by ammonia, which, added in excess, redissolves the precipitate
formed by it. Iodine water, iodized potassium iodide,
and picric acid precipitate the solutions of salts of Cocaine.
When Cocaine is heated to 100° in a sealed tube with concentrated
hydrochloric acid, it separates into benzoic acid
and a new base, for which M. W&oelig;hler has proposed the
name of <i>Ecgonine</i>. Lassen has discovered another nitrogenous
base resulting from the separation of Cocaine&mdash;<i>hygrine</i>.</p>

<p><cite>Preparation.</cite>&mdash;The process used by Niemann for obtaining
Cocaine is as follows:</p>

<p>This chemist digested Coca leaves, cut into very small
pieces, in alcohol (at 55°), for several days, adding sulphuric
acid. The tincture which resulted from this operation
was separated by expression, filtered, and treated
with slaked lime. The liquid, which was primarily of a
greenish-brown, was both divested of a part of its chlorophyll
and also of a certain waxy substance. Niemann
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>then neutralized this with sulphuric acid and evaporated
it over a water-bath. The residue was then treated with
water, which caused the separation of the rest of the chlorophyll
and of the sulphate of Cocaine that it contained, and
which was precipitated by means of the carbonate of
sodium. He separated it finally with ether and purified
it by several re-crystallizations in alcohol. This process
was modified by Lassen, who precipitated the aqueous solution
with the subacetate of lead.</p>

<p>In this way he was able to obtain about six grammes of
Cocaine from a kilogramme of Coca leaves.</p>

<p>Moreno y Maïz proposed a third process. He mixed
intimately, slaked lime with finely-pulverized Coca leaves,
letting the mixture stand for nearly twenty-four hours, in
order that the lime might react suitably on the alkaloid,
imitating in that, the Indian who mixes with his quid the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">llipta</i>, of which we have already spoken. He afterward
lixiviates it with alcohol at 40°.</p>


<h4><abbr title="two">II.</abbr>&mdash;PHYSICAL STUDY.</h4>

<p>We have reviewed the works of the different authors
who occupied themselves with Coca; their various labors,
although very interesting, did not reach the famous discovery
of local anæsthesia, and it is to Köller, of Vienna<a name="Anchor_10" id="Anchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 10.">[10]</a>,
that the honor belongs of having brought to light the remarkable
effect of Cocaine when applied to the conjunctival
membrane.</p>

<p>This soon awakened general curiosity. From all quarters
came works on the subject. Reuss, K&oelig;nigstein,
Jellinck, Schrotter, Knapp and others hastened to give to
the profession the result of their researches.</p>

<p>In France enthusiasm was not less strong, nor less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>prompt, all those whom this discovery interested undertook
a series of experiments with Cocaine<a name="Anchor_11" id="Anchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 11.">[11]</a>.</p>

<p>Among the first experimenters we must mention specially,
Prof. Panas, Prof. Vulpian, Prof. Dujardin-Beaumetz,
Dr. Terrier, Dr. Trousseau, Dr. Dehenne.</p>

<p>Prof. Panas reports in a communication made by him to
the <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Académie de Médecine</span><a name="Anchor_12" id="Anchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 12.">[12]</a> what he has observed.</p>

<p>He states, besides, that in nearly all respects his personal
investigations are confirmatory of those made by Köller.</p>

<p>About five minutes after a few drops of a solution of
hydrochloride of Cocaine composed of 0.5 gramme of that
salt to a gramme of distilled water have been instilled into
the eye, anæsthesia of the conjunctival mucous membrane
of the cornea begins to manifest itself and reaches the deep
parts in about fifteen or twenty minutes if the instillations
are repeated every five minutes.</p>

<p>At the same time there is a certain amount of mydriasis,
but this is less pronounced than that produced by atropine.
This pupillary dilatation, which is more perceptible in
young subjects and not in glaucomatous states, lasts, at
least, for twenty-four hours. With that occurs a slight
paralysis of the ciliary muscle.</p>

<p>"On account of this," says Professor Panas, "Cocaine
should be placed among the slightly mydriatic substances
of which the passing effect might be utilized for ophthalmoscopic
explorations of the fundus of the eye, under the
same head as, and better than, homatropine."</p>

<p>According to M. Dujardin-Beaumetz, Cocaine not only
deadens sensibility, but it can further be utilized with
morphinomaniacs as a substitute for morphine without
presenting the objections of the latter substance; and he
adds that subcutaneous injections made with this alkaloid
are not irritating (<cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bulletin de l'Académie de Médecine</cite>, session
of the 18th of November, 1884).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Prof. Vulpian, at the outset, communicated to the Académie
des Sciences the results of his interesting physiological
researches with the chlorhydrate of Cocaine.</p>

<p>M. Vulpian, after observing similar anæsthetic and analgesic
effects on the eye in animals as already shown in
man, resulting from an instillation between the eyelids of
a few drops of solution of hydrochlorate of Cocaine, and
also perceiving under these conditions the mydriatic action
of the salt, noticed a protrusion of the ocular globe
when he injected 0.10 centigramme of hydrochloride of
Cocaine of a one to one hundred aqueous solution into the
saphenous vein of a non-curarized dog, and that it occurred
almost immediately after throwing the liquid into
the vessel. Instantly the eyelids were seen to separate and
the pupillary orifice to enlarge. "This," says he, "is an
effect which exactly recalls the results of faradization of
the upper extremity of the cervical sympathetic nerve cut
transversely."</p>

<p>Complete anæsthesia of the two transparent corneæ
existed in this case.</p>

<p>Prof. Grasset, of Montpelier, almost at the same time as
Vulpian, observed the same effects of Cocaine, but a greater
persistency in the phenomena of insensibility following
the intravenous injection of the solution of hydrochloride
of Cocaine.</p>

<p>At about that time, Dr. Laborde, of the <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Académie de Médecine</span>,
treated still more deeply of the action of Cocaine in
three successive notes to the <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Société de Biologie</span> (Nov. 22d
and 29th and Dec. 27th, 1884). This learned physiologist
studied the analgesic action generally resulting from subcutaneous
injections of 0.03 of hydrochloride of Cocaine,
in three doses, in the guinea-pig. He saw it at the same
time produce a general hyper-excitability which irresistibly
forced the animal to move, and even produced epileptic
convulsions; the general analgesic state lasted for more
than forty-eight hours.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>
<p>M. Laborde, in attributing the secondary peripheric
analgesia of intravenous or subcutaneous injections of
hydrochlorate of Cocaine to the cerebral insusceptibility
to pain, unconsciously made Cocaine a general anæsthetic.</p>

<p>Prof. Arloing (1885, <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mémoire Soc. Biologie</cite>) has undertaken
many experiments for demonstrating that Cocaine is not a
general anæsthetic.</p>

<p>In his experiments, the learned physiologist of Lyons
confirmed the results obtained by Vulpian as to the modifications
occasioned by Cocaine of the arterial pressure; he
saw, like his predecessors, the excito-medullary and convulsary
effect of large doses of Cocaine and the increase of
the salivary secretion, and in regard to its cerebro-spinal
effect, he compared it to strychnine. General analgesia did
not occur except from fatal doses or when accompanied by
convulsions. The hydrochlorate of Cocaine, according to
M. Arloing, produces and can produce nothing but local
anæsthesia by temporarily changing the physical properties
of the protoplasm of the terminal and fibrillary nervous
elements easily accessible to medicinal agents in the cornea
and mucous surfaces.</p>

<p>We will presently show that the several learned men
who have been engaged in investigating the mechanism
of action of the active principles of Coca were by no
means in accord as regards the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus agendi</i> of Cocaine in
the production of local anæsthesia.</p>

<p>While M. Dujardin-Beaumetz likens the local anæsthetic
action of Cocaine to that of cold, and while M. Laborde
considers that it produces a diminished blood supply by the
vaso-constrictor action of the great sympathetic nervous
system, M. Arloing, on the contrary, explains it by a local
action on the nervous protoplasm.</p>

<p>Moreover, in 1886, Schilling, a supporter of the vascular
theory, advised inhalations of nine drops of nitrite of
amyl, in three doses, inhalations which caused dilatation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>of the vessels, to revive patients poisoned with injections
of Cocaine hydrochlorate.</p>

<p>In repeating these experiments in the laboratory, Dr.
Laffont has succeeded little by little in enlarging his field
of experiments, and finally has given to the <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Académie
de Médecine</span> (session of the 4th of January, 1888), a
complete and definitive account of the action of the active
principles of Coca on the different functions of the economy.
This work of original researches and criticism of
previous works will serve to explain the methodical and
rational use of our preparations in the list of the different
diseases where our former previsions had already led us to
advise them.</p>

<p>In an earlier work (Comptes-rendus, <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Société de Biologie</cite>,
Dec. 3, 1887), Dr. Laffont, studying the action of Cocaine
on the great sympathetic nervous system, found that under
the action of the active principle of Coca the functions of
all the constrictor fibres of the great sympathetic nerve
were increased.</p>

<p>The stomach contracts.</p>

<p>The intestines undergo an augmentation in peristalsis
and borborygmi are heard.</p>

<p>The bladder invariably contracts, as M. Laborde has also
seen.</p>

<p>The orbital capsule of the eye (smooth muscle) propels
the eye-ball forward.</p>

<p>The pupil is dilated.</p>

<p>In a word, all the smooth-fibred muscles or muscles of
organic life, subordinate to the great sympathetic nervous
system constrictor, undergo an augmentation of functional
activity.</p>

<p>In a second essay (<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Comptes-rendus</span>, <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Société de Biologie</cite>,
Dec. 17, 1887), the same experimenter studied more particularly
the mechanism of the local or general analgesic
action of Cocaine, and, like M. Arloing, as opposed to
M. Laborde, he found that the cerebral perceptibility was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>not deadened, by a physiological dose, but on the contrary,
increased.</p>

<p>The action of Cocaine on the nervous system is not
exerted by the intervention of vascular constriction; it is
a generalized exciting action, and a state of peripheric
non-receptivity of external impressions<a name="Anchor_13" id="Anchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 13.">[13]</a> in the nervous
extremities of the sensory nerves and the nerves of general
sensation.</p>

<p>Cocaine, according to M. Laffont, is not the antagonist
of curare, as M. Laborde describes it, but quite the contrary,
a particular curare, acting like it on the periphery,
and not affecting the nervous centers, the functional action
of which is exaggerated thereby.</p>

<p><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">M. le docteur</span> Beugniès-Corbeau describes fully in the
<cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Revue hebdomadaire de Thérapeutique générale et thermale</cite>, the
internal effects of Coca, until now so obscure, and in regard
to which no concrete doctrine had been formulated until
<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">M. le docteur</span> Laffont presented to the <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Académie de Médecine</span>
his researches. He shows that Coca, from its active
principles, should have these entirely distinct actions:</p>

<p>1<sup>o</sup> Action on the protoplasm of the nervous extremities
of the sensory nerves and on the nerves of general sensibility,
producing non-transmissibility to the nerves of painful
and even sensorized impressions, in a large dose;</p>

<p>2<sup>o</sup> Excito-functional action on the cerebro-spinal nervous
centers, producing an augmentation of intellectual and
muscular activity;</p>

<p>3<sup>o</sup> Excito-functional action on the great sympathetic constrictor
nerve, consequently an exaltation of the functional
action of all the non-striated muscles or muscles of organic
life, which are subordinate to it.</p>

<p>Considering these distinct properties of the active principles
of Coca, M. Laffont explains the long-recognized
virtues of Coca, in that they conserve the natural forces,
notwithstanding the withdrawal of aliments, in the following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>manner: "The exciting cerebro-medullary action of
these principles causes an increase of the intellectual and
physical activity, at the same time that the analgesic
action on the extremities of the sensitive and sensory
nerves, prevents the pangs of hunger, and consequently
the accompanying moral and physical depression."</p>

<p>From another point of view, M. Laffont adds, that the
dynamogenic action of the active principles of Coca on the
smooth-fibered muscles "indicates its use in the list of
atonic gastro-intestinal diseases, flatulent dyspepsia, dilatation
of the stomach, paresis of the intestines, of the
bladder, etc."</p>

<p>It is impossible for us to recount here all the trials which
have been made with Cocaine; we will only quote the
names of Dr. Deneffe, Dr. Charpentier, Dr. Morell Mackenzie,
Dr. Lennox Browne, Dr. Sajous, Dr. J. Leonard
Corning, Dr. Beverly Robinson, Dr. Louis Elsberg, Dr. W.
Oliver Moore, Dr. Vincenzo Cozzolino, Dr. Abadie, Dr.
Galezowski, Dr. Meyer, Dr. de Wecker, Dr. Doléris, Dr.
David Colombe, Dr. Rigolet, and Dr. Brasseur, the majority
of whom have studied this question from an ocular,
therapeutical, obstetrical, dental, and laryngological point
of view.</p>

Now</span> that we understand the physiological properties
of Coca and Cocaine, we come to the study
of the different morbid states in which these
substances may be usefully employed.</p>


<h3>DISEASES OF THE MOUTH.</h3>

<p>Gazeau advises the use of Coca for inflammations of the
mouth and gums. Pain is assuaged, ptyalism removed,
and the inflammation itself favorably influenced. He
cites, in support of his opinion, the use which the Peruvians
make of it in affections of the mouth, and mentions
cases of mercurial stomatitis treated with this agent and
cured in a short time, in his practice.</p>

<p>Demarle<a name="Anchor_14" id="Anchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 14.">[14]</a>, before him, expressed himself thus: "I
have used Coca for mercurial stomatitis. The affection
disappeared on the third day of treatment; nothing else
had been administered."</p>

<p>In cases where the gums are soft, fungous, ulcerated, or
bleeding, and these changes depend on local or constitutional
conditions, Coca is equally indicated. Gazeau prefers
it even to potassium chlorate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>According to Dr. Colombe<a name="Anchor_15" id="Anchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 15.">[15]</a>, Coca is a potent factor in
the treatment of syphilis.<a name="Anchor_16" id="Anchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 16.">[16]</a> "It is demonstrated that
potassium iodide and potassium chlorate undergo double
decomposition in the system, and thus interfere with each
other's action. Coca, substituted for the chlorate under
such circumstances, would not be open to the same objection.
It would find its application, therefore, when the
mixed treatment is found necessary."</p>


<h3>DISEASES OF THE THROAT, PHARYNX AND
THE LARYNX.</h3>

<p>As regards the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anginæ</i>, the acute inflammations of the
larynx and pharynx, we might repeat what has been said
about inflammations of the mouth. In particular, the pain,
so violent in certain <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anginæ</i>, calls for this method of treatment.
The same is true of the dysphagia which accompanies
them.</p>

<p>Charles Fauvel first recognized the virtues of Coca in
the tingling of follicular <i>angina</i> and the laryngeal pains
of tuberculous subjects. In those cases he specifies Mariani's
extract of Coca leaves in preference to solutions
of Cocaine, which sometimes give rise to symptoms of
poisoning.</p>

<p>Dr. Rouquette<a name="Anchor_17" id="Anchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 17.">[17]</a> relates a case of tubercular laryngitis
in which symptoms of poisoning showed themselves as
early as the third day; the parts had been painted twice
a day with a five-per-cent solution of Cocaine.</p>

<p>Dr. Paul Legendre has quite recently mentioned anew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>the danger that may result from a too free use of Cocaine<a name="Anchor_18" id="Anchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 18.">[18]</a>.
The case was that of an interne of the hospitals
attacked with diphtheria who, in order that he might the
better bear the spraying with caustics, had his throat
painted with a solution of Cocaine. Toward the seventh
day he experienced very grave symptoms of poisoning,
and the painting had to be suspended.</p>

<p>It is better, in cases of this sort, to prescribe extract of
Coca, which answers the same purposes without the attendant
danger of Cocaine.</p>

<p>One of the greatest triumphs of extract of Coca is assuredly
its action in dysphagia and in the vomiting of consumptives,
as also in the vomiting of pregnancy. The first
two complications are of the gravest kind, for they condemn
to starvation patients whose only chance of safety
lies in the activity of the digestive organs (Ch. Fauvel and
Coupard).</p>


<h3>DISEASES OF THE STOMACH.</h3>

<p>Authors who have given attention to Coca speak very
highly of its employment in gastralgia and tardy and
laborious digestion.</p>

<p>Demarle says on this subject: "Personally, I have found
the use of Coca, either before or after eating, excellent for
gastrodynia and pyrosis, to which I am subject; hardly
have I swallowed the first bit of saliva when the whole
unpleasant feeling disappears."</p>

<p>Mantegazza speaks of its use in the same strain. The
cephalic congestion which accompanies his digestion is
relieved; he can work after eating without feeling any
uneasiness.</p>

<p>Dr. Ch. Gazeau (<cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Thèse pour le Doctorat</cite>, Paris, 1870, Parent,
édit., pp. 61 <i>et seq.</i>) thus sums up the physiological action
of Coca: "On the stomach, slight excitation, anæsthesia,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>and probably an increase of the secretion of gastric juice;
on the intestines, an increase of the intestinal secretions, etc.
These manifold physiological effects upon the digestive
tube unite in a specific action, so to speak, in the numerous
functional troubles, so varied and so ill-understood, of
the organs that compose it."</p>

<p>The same author cites a great number of cases of this
sort in which Coca "has never failed to exert an admirable
action, often even marvelous." And he concludes (page
65): "It seems to me useless to bring forward more examples;
these are enough to justify this positive general
conclusion: Coca is the remedy <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i> for diseases
of the digestive tube."</p>

<p>Beugniès-Corbeau<a name="Anchor_19" id="Anchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 19.">[19]</a> prescribes it in chloro-anæmia,
not only for gastralgia, but for the frequent desire to eat
which patients feel, disappearing as soon as the first
mouthful has been taken, only to return a little while
afterward.</p>

<p>Prof. O. Réveil ends his article on Coca as follows:
"Much remains to be done in the physiological and clinical
study of Coca; it is known that it acts on the motor and
sensory nervous system. This substance is destined some
day to take an important rank in therapeutics."</p>

<p>In irritability and various affections of the cerebral centers,
Dr. J. Leonard Corning makes use of Coca, which he
prefers to the bromides.</p>

<p>In a very remarkable essay on <i>Erythroxylon Coca</i>, published
at Ixelles, in 1885, a perusal of which we urge upon
all who are interested in the study of Coca, Dr. A. Feigneau
says (page 61):</p>

<p>"There can be no mistake that, to a certain extent, Coca
stimulates the cerebra-spinal activity by suspending or retarding
the destruction of tissue in the economy, and that
its action may modify the functions of the nervous centers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>provided there are no such contra-indications to its use as
active congestion, inflammation, or organic changes in
these organs."</p>

<p>"Consequently it would be indicated under all circumstances
where a nervous affection seemed to depend upon
a state of ataxia."</p>

<p>"In irritations of the spinal cord, in mental aberration
accompanied by melancholia, as well as against idiopathic
convulsions (Mantegazza) and nervous paraplegia."</p>

<p>Dr. Beverley Robinson considers the Vin Mariani as a
cardiac tonic<a name="Anchor_20" id="Anchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 20.">[20]</a>:</p>

<p>"On several occasions, when digitalis has proved to be
useless or injurious, I have had very excellent results from
caffeine or convallaria. Certainly, the latter drug is more
easily tolerated by a sensitive stomach than digitalis is;
and whenever the nervous supply of the heart is especially
implicated, I believe that I secure more quieting effects
from its employment. Among well known cardiac tonics
and stimulants for obtaining temporary good effects, at
least, I know of no drug quite equal to Coca. Given in the
form of wine or fluid extract, it does much, at times, to restore
the heart-muscle to its former tone. I have obtained
the best effects from the use of Mariani's wine. From personal
information given me by this reliable pharmacist,
these results are attributable to the excellent quality of the
Coca leaves and of the wine which he uses in its manufacture."</p>

<p>In cases of morphinomania, Dr. Dujardin-Beaumetz has
pointed out the advantage to be obtained with the Vin
Mariani, and, following him, Dr. Palmer, of Louisville,
and Dr. Sigmaux Treux, of Vienna, have obtained excellent
results with this therapeutic agent. Further on, we give a
case of Dr. Villeneuve's, showing the cure of a morphinomaniac
by the combined use of the Vin and the Pâte
(Mariani).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. H. Libermann recommends the use of Coca, in the
form of Vin Mariani, against morphinomania, nicotinism
and alcoholism.</p>

<p>"In <em>general diseases</em> it is to the stimulating properties of
the plant that recourse is oftenest had. These properties
make it the tonic <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i> whenever the object is to
build up a system that has been enfeebled from any cause.
Its preparations, accordingly, may be ordered in convalescence
from all grave fevers, in anæmia and chloro-anæmia,
in all diathetic or cachætic conditions, whatever may have
been their original cause (chronic rheumatism, gout,
genito-urinary affection, cancer, etc.), in short, in all
cases where the system is debilitated from any cause
whatever."</p>

<p>But it is, above all, in diseases that have a depressing
action on the nervous system that the effect of Coca is truly
marvelous. Gubler, in his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Commentaires de thérapeutique</cite>,
shows himself its warm champion. "Coca," says he, "very
much like tea and coffee, lends to the nervous system the
force with which it is charged, after the manner of a fulminate,
but with this difference, that it yields it gradually
and not all at once."</p>

<p>The theory of the <i>fulminates</i>, invented by M. Gubler, tallies
so well with observed facts, that Mantegazza, without
generalizing and without pretending to form a theory, but
limiting himself to describing by simile what he had seen,
truer probably than he himself supposed, said: "Under
the influence of Coca, it seems that a new force is gradually
introduced into our organism, like water into a
sponge." (A. Dechambre.)</p>

<p>This opinion has been corroborated by all authors who
have given attention to the question, and it may be looked
upon as one of the least contestible in therapeutics.</p>

<p>We will add, what is quite important, that as a tonic
Coca has been found far superior to cinchona, iron, strychnine,
etc. Everybody knows their astringent action, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>makes them give rise to such obstinate constipation that
there are patients in whom it is often necessary to suspend
their use. There is no such objection to Coca; it
never constipates, and practically its use may be continued
indefinitely.</p>

Immediately</span> after the importation of the Coca
leaf into Europe, we conceived the plan, the
outcome of the request of many physicians, of
making preparations from Coca. <i>Vin Mariani.</i>&mdash;<i>Elixir
Mariani.</i>&mdash;<i>Pâte Mariani.</i>&mdash;<i>Thé Mariani.</i>&mdash;<i>Pastilles
Mariani</i>, etc. (The author's name was kindly added to his
preparations by the medical profession, who had recognized
the superiority of his products.)</p>

<p>These different preparations had been used by our greatest
practitioners long before the discovery, or rather the
application of Cocaine.</p>

<p>The results obtained were marvelous, and the innumerable
letters which were addressed to us by physicians who
experimented with and used our products and rendered
accounts in the medical journals in all parts of the world,
would fill several large volumes.<a name="Anchor_21" id="Anchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 21.">[21]</a></p>

<p>Under the esteemed patronage of our greatest medical
celebrities, our preparations are known all over the world;
they have reached all classes of society and everywhere, in
the large cities as in the small villages, men, women, children,
in fact, convalescents of all ages now know the name
of the salutary plant, which it is and has been our effort
to popularize, though strictly so according to the code of
medical ethics and by those channels approved of by the
entire medical profession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>We shall now consider the different ways in which we
use Coca, and which under the well-known forms of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vin</i>,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élixir</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pâte</i>, and of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">thé Mariani</i>, have received such universal
recognition. We will show incidentally the esteem in
which these preparations are held by the highest medical
authorities.</p>


<h3><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">VIN</span> MARIANI.</h3>

<p>This is the first of the preparations of Coca and the one
most generally adopted; to the tonic and stimulant action
of the drug there is added that of a choice quality of wine.</p>

<p><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin</span> Mariani contains the soluble parts of the Coca plant.
The combination of Coca, with the tannin and the slight
traces of iron which this wine naturally contains, is pronounced
the most efficacious of tonics.</p>

<p>The fresh Coca leaves that we employ, after careful selection,
come from three different sources and are of incomparable
quality. It is this that gives to our <em>wine</em> that
special taste and agreeable aroma which renders it so acceptable
to the sick.</p>

<p>It is likewise to the combination and preparing of these
three varieties of Coca leaf in our wine that we can attribute
this important fact: during more than thirty years, no
matter in how large doses taken, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i> has never
produced <i>cocainism</i>, nor any other unpleasant effects.<a name="Anchor_22" id="Anchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 22.">[22]</a></p>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i> is a diffusible tonic, the action of which is
immediate. This action, instead of being localized on a single
organ, the stomach, spreads to the whole system. Taken
into the circulation, it awakens in its course the retarded
functions of every organ, and this is owing to the presence
in our preparation of the volatile principles of the plant.</p>

<p>Unlike other tonics, the astringent properties of which
lead at length to heat and constipation, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i> does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>not produce any disorder of the digestive functions; it
stimulates them, exerts a refreshing action on the gastric
mucous membrane, and on that account so advantageously
replaces the preparations of cinchona, iron, strychnine, etc.</p>

<p>"There is," says Dr. Mallez, "a form of anæmia to which
the attention of physicians has not yet been called, and
which yields marvelously to the employment of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin
Mariani</i>; we allude to that state of profound depression of
the economy, of extremely marked impoverishment of the
blood, which also results from the prolonged abuse of balsamics
in the treatment of diseases of the urinary passages.</p>

<p>"The number of persons who, attacked with blennorrhagia,
use cubebs, copaiba, turpentine, etc., to a deplorable
extent is considerable. So true is this that, out of a hundred
young dyspeptics, we may affirm without fear of being
in error that at least forty of them have become so by the
use of balsamics.</p>

<p>"In like manner, the number of patients affected with
urinary gravel whom the prolonged and excessive use of
the agents just mentioned, has rendered dyspeptic and
then neuropathic is enormous. Like the former, they owe
the profound disorder of their digestive functions to the
immoderate use of resins and oleo-resins.</p>

<p>"It is of the first importance, therefore, to relieve these
persons by making them take, after having given them light
laxatives and some preparations intended to strengthen
the stomach, not iron, not cinchona, not, as we have said
above, local tonics, which would be of little if any use, but
diffusible tonics, that is to say, those that act upon the local
condition and at the same time upon the general condition,
and which, moreover, do not constipate.</p>

<p>"It is here that <i>Vin Mariani</i>, proves its great advantage
and succeeds where other tonics have failed, in stimulating
the functions of the stomach. On the one hand by the
small quantity of tannin which it contains, on the other
through the active principles of Coca, associated with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>wine, which serves as a vehicle, exciting the vitality of
each organ separately, not, however, without having previously
exerted its vivifying action on the mucous membrane
of the stomach itself." (<cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Gazette des Hopitaux</cite>, Nov.
23, 1877.)</p>

<p>The analgesic properties of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i> have received a
happy application in clinical laryngoscopy by Dr. Ch. Fauvel.
This eminent specialist has made use of it for the
past twenty-six years with unvarying success in all affections
of the laryngeal mucous membrane, the air passages,
and the vocal organs. In granular angina it takes the place
of the topical medication and cauterizations which are so
often injurious when they are used indiscriminately and to
excess.</p>

<p>The employment of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i> rapidly relieves patients
of the feeling of heat and tingling which is
one of the most annoying symptoms of this very common
disease of the throat. (<cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Gazette des Hopitaux</cite>, May
12, 1877.)</p>

<p>Dr. Beverley Robinson recommends <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i> as a
heart tonic.</p>

<p>Dr. W. H. Pancoast says that <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i> is a valuable
preparation and a tonic of the highest merit.</p>

<p>Dr. Jules Bouvyer, of Cauteretz, employs it with success
in certain affections of the larynx as an adjuvant to the
sulphurous treatment.</p>

<p>In 1875, in his <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Traitement rationnel de la phthisie pulmonaire</cite>,
Dr. de Pietra Santa said, page 394:</p>

<p>"Among the most renowned practitioners of Paris, Péan,
Barth, G. Sée, and Cabrol have promptly adopted the preparations
of Coca. Ch. Fauvel prescribes it in affections of
the respiratory passages. It is in these diseases that I, too,
have had occasion to advise its daily use in the most convenient,
the most agreeable, and the most active form&mdash;that
of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Tonique de Mariani</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus has been realized Réveil's prediction: "This substance
(Coca) is destined to take an important rank in
therapeutics."</p>

<p>In the <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Revue de Thérapeutique médicaux-chirurgicale</cite>, June
11, 1876, page 381. <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bibliographie</span>: <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Dictionnaire Encyclopédique
des sciences médicales</cite>, par A. Dechambre, Dr. H. Cottin
thus closes his article:</p>

<p>"In France, we are using a great deal of Coca wine, and it
is tending to take the place of all other tonic wines; it is
borne a longer time by the stomach and is more agreeable
to the palate. M. Mariani has contributed much to the
popularization of Coca by the perfection of his preparations,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vin</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">thé élixir</i> and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pâte</i>. These are the forms at present
most employed."</p>

<p>Dr. Chapusot, of Paris, thus sums up his personal observations:
"A claret-glass of this wine has always been
enough to make me forget hunger and to sustain my
strength; I have felt a grateful warmth and a general
exaltation of the economy; the digestion of the following
meal has always been easier than if I had not taken the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i>, and, although I had not such a ravenous
appetite as if I had gone without it, I ate a good deal, the
stomach appearing stronger and more active."</p>

<p>It was Dr. Ch. Fauvel who gave our wine the very striking
and exact title of "Tensor of the vocal cords." He
says: "Thanks to <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i>, I have been able to restore
the voice of many lyric artists who would have been unable
without this potent agent to give their performances."</p>

<p>Dr. J. Leonard Corning, in <cite>Brain Exhaustion</cite>, New York,
1884, pages 78 and 112, says: "Of all the medicaments that
I employ in the very numerous cases of irritability, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin
Mariani</i> has rendered the greatest service. I do not except
even the bromides, for this preparation of Coca possesses
the calmative properties of those salts without producing
the unpleasant depression which characterizes them."</p>

<p>The same author continues:</p>

<p>"The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i> is the remedy <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i> for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>At the same time it produces a fortifying action on the
cerebral center and gives rise to a decided sensation of
well-being."</p>

<p>Dr. Morell Mackenzie, London, advises the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i>
as a stimulant and tonic, and uses it especially with speakers
and singers.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">19 Harley Street,<br />

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:&mdash;I have much pleasure in stating that I
have used the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i> for many years, and consider it
a valuable stimulant, particularly serviceable in the cases
of vocalists.</p>

<p class="quotsig">
Yours faithfully,<br />
<span class="smcap">Morell Mackenzie, M. D.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>Professor Sajous, of Philadelphia, who has experimented
with <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i> in troubles of the vocal organs, has
obtained excellent results from its use, and he advises
it, not only as a restorative of the voice, but as a general
tonic.</p>

<p>Dr. Libermann, Surgeon-in-Chief, French Army, communicates
his experience, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I have the honor to inform you of the results which I
have obtained in my long career of military practice from
the use of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i>.</p>

<p>"I have used it with great success for profound anæmia
resulting from long and tedious campaigns in hot countries,
and accompanied, as is nearly always the case, by gastro-intestinal
irritation with loss of appetite and dyspepsia.
Two or three Bordeaux-glasses of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i> daily, removed
that condition quite rapidly, by restoring the appetite
and the tolerance of the stomach for a tonic aliment.</p>

<p>"I have also employed it in cases, happily rare in our
army, of chronic alcoholism resulting from the abuse of
brandy, absinthe or strong liquors. The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i> produced
all the excitement sought by drinkers, but had at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>the same time a sedative influence on their nervous systems.
I have frequently seen hardened drinkers renounce
their fatal habit and return to a healthy condition.</p>

<p>"I have also used <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i> to save smokers of exaggerated
habits, from nicotinism. A few glasses of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin
Mariani</i> taken in small doses, either pure or mixed with
water, acted as a substitute for pipes and cigars, because
the smokers found in it the cerebral excitement which
they sought in tobacco, wholly preserving their intellectual
faculties.</p>

<p>"I have also employed it with success for chronic bronchitis
and pulmonary phthisis. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i> increases the
appetite and diminishes the cough in these two morbid
states.</p>

<p>"To combat the cough I give it mixed with water in the
form of tisane, a Bordeaux-glass of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mariani</i> in a glass of
hot water.</p>

<p>"Besides I have used it to the greatest advantage in
convalescence from typhoid fever, when no wine, not even
Bordeaux, was retained by the stomach on account of gastric
irritation which is the rule after fevers of this nature.</p>

<p>"Although I have confined myself to giving but a rapid
glance at the results that I have obtained, I have the statistics,
which I keep in reserve should they be needed.</p>

<p>"I can certify that <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i> is the most powerful
weapon that can be put in the hands of military physicians
to combat the diseases, the infirmities, and even the vicious
habits engendered by camp life and the servitude of military
existence."</p></div>

<p>Dr. Villeneuve, among other cases of morphinomania
conquered by the combined use of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pâte</i> and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin
Mariani</i>, communicated to us in 1884 the following observation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"M. X...., barrister, 32 years of age, five years ago
began to use morphine preparations as a remedy against a
very alarming chronic bronchitis and granulations in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>throat, which were irritated constantly by cigarette smoking.</p>

<p>"The patient at first only used morphine, but his physicians
committed the imprudence of treating him by
hypodermic injection. A notable change for the better
was produced during the first month, but, unfortunately,
abuse succeeded promptly the use of the medicament&mdash;so
much so that when I commenced to treat the patient, he
was taking daily from 1 gramme 50 centigrammes to 1
gramme 80 centigrammes of morphine hypodermically.
When he was four hours without his dose there appeared
insomnia, hallucinations and delirium; constipation lasting
sometimes for fifteen days, which brought on in the
spring a very alarming perityphlitis, jerking of the muscles,
sudden frights, dyspepsia, and at last frightful congestion
of the face whenever he drank a drop of wine or
brandy.</p>

<p>"After a month's treatment I had succeeded in reducing
the daily doses without causing alarming symptoms; the
physiological functions seemed to awaken again. However,
the congestion and especially the dyspepsia was very
grave, and the cough which had been suppressed by morphine
returned. It was then that I treated my patient
with phosphate of lime, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pâte</i> and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i>. Lacking
his habitual stimulant, he was plunged in a semi-coma
from which he could not always be relieved with
weaker daily doses of morphine.</p>

<p>"The danger I feared most was a relapse of bronchitis,
and that the cough and expectoration might end fatally.
But in about a week, during which he took ten doses of
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Pâte de Coca</i> daily, the cough became less fatiguing and disappeared
entirely in about twenty days. The patient then
commenced to take small doses of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i> (two Madeira-glasses
a day). At first congestion appeared, but little by
little, as digestion became more easy, my patient, who on
account of his profound anæmia could not tolerate any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>table wines, took at first a small glass, then two, then three
glasses at a meal. Now he can go and take his dinner in
town, which he had not been able to do for three years; he
regained his former vigor, is able to undertake anew his
occupations, and has entirely given up his morphine habit."</p></div>

<p>We will conclude our quotations, already too numerous,
with an article by Dr. Scaglia, published in 1877 in the
<cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Gazette des Hopitaux</cite>: "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">La Coca et ses propriétés thérapeutiques.</span>"</p>

<p>"In anæmia, connected with chronic pulmonary affections
without fever, and in anæmia accompanied by gastralgia,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i> has an excellent effect. Its stimulating
properties can also be admirably made use of in those
intermediate states of impaired health which are not yet
anæmia, but must in the end become so; physical or mental
overwork, the cerebral weakness due to excess of work or
pleasure; the exhaustion from which the inhabitants of
large cities suffer through irregularities of diet and imperfect
hygiene owing to their positions and surroundings.</p>

<p>"<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i> is unquestionably of benefit to people of
sedentary habits worn out by work, to convalescents who,
from a prolonged confinement in bed, have lost muscular
strength, to patients suffering from diabetes or Bright's
disease, whose muscles have lost their elasticity and vigor.</p>

<p>"Let us add that the taste of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i> is exquisite,
that it is in no way suggestive of drugs, and that its use is
acceptable to the most fastidious."</p></div>

<p>Ordinary Dose&mdash;Two or three claret-glassfuls daily, half
an hour before or immediately after eating.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coca Grog.</span>&mdash;By mixing a wineglassful of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i>
with half a glassful of boiling water, sweetened to the
taste, we get a grog of exquisite flavor, and capable of rendering
the greatest services whenever an immediate effect
is desired in severe cases of cold, attended by convulsive
coughing. (As prescribed by Dr. Libermann, Dr. Cyrus
Edson and others, recorded in the medical journals during
the grip epidemics.)</p>

<h3>ELIXIR MARIANI.</h3>

<p>The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Elixir Mariani</i> is more alcoholic, very agreeable to
the taste, and three times as highly charged with the
aromatic principles of the Coca leaf as the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i>;
therefore it should be taken in doses of a liqueur glassful,
in the morning upon rising, and after the two principal
meals.</p>

<p>It may be used clear or mixed with water, in nearly all
cases where the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i> is used. Its tonic and eminently
digestive properties and its special aroma, at once
mild and penetrating, make it an agreeable liqueur, very
much esteemed by gourmets and persons who are careful
about their health.</p>

<p>A small glass of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Elixir Mariani</i> taken after a meal,
spreads a gentle warmth through the stomach and calls
forth an abundant secretion of gastric juice, which mixes
with the food and facilitates digestion.</p>

<p>For travelers, hunters, and in general all who walk
much and who are exposed to fatigue, to dampness,
and to fog, the use of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Elixir Mariani</i> may be recommended
and will render admirable service, because of
the tone and strength that it gives to the stomach and
to the muscles.</p>

<p>Dr. Collins, <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Révue de Thérapeutique</cite>, observes that this
liqueur acts "heroically" in anæmia, chlorosis and rickets.</p>

<p>Dr. Ch. Fauvel, Dr. Conqueret, Dr. Villeneuve, Dr. Chapusot,
Dr. Odin, Dr. Cintrat and others declare as the result
of their clinical observations that the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Elixir Mariani</i> exerts
a "masterly action" in granular pharyngitis, quinsy, and
albuminuria, and that its stimulating properties on the
whole nervous system cannot be denied.</p>

<p>Dr. J. Leonard Corning, of New York, recommends the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Elixir Mariani</i> as a strengthener of the brain.</p>

<p>"As a remedy in <em>sea-sickness</em>, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Elixir Mariani</i> has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>always given excellent results."&mdash;Dr. Slant, Dr. Letellier,
Dr. Trossat, Dr. Derrecagaix.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Elixir Mariani</i> is generally prescribed in doses of a
liqueur-glassful after the principal meals. Mixed with cold
water, in the proportion of two liqueur-glassfuls to a tumbler
of water, it constitutes a very strengthening and pleasant
drink.</p>


<h3><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">PÂTE</span> MARIANI (LOZENGES OF COCA).</h3>

<p>Tonic and pectoral, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Pâte Mariani</i> is a Lozenge very
agreeable to the taste, which is prescribed daily with the
greatest success by throat specialists for obstinate coughs,
granular catarrh of the throat, and the various inflammations
of the digestive and respiratory passages. Composed
only of clarified gum, sugar and Coca, without a trace of
opium or of any narcotic substances, it may be taken without
danger at any hour of the day and in any quantity,
without fear of its disturbing the digestion, since, on the
contrary, it can only aid it. From six to ten of the Lozenges
daily are the usual dose, but more may be taken if
necessary.</p>

<p>Its beneficial action is due to the happy combination of
the emolient properties of pure gum-arabic and the tonic,
astringent and analgesic properties of Coca.</p>

<p>"<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Pâte Mariani</i> has a powerful tonic action on the larynx,
and, like <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i>, it is invaluable in cases of aphonia
caused by feebleness or relaxation of the vocal cords. This
property is of special advantage to singers and orators. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Pâte
Mariani</i> is a very valuable substitute in granular catarrh of
the throat and throat affections in general, for chlorate of
potassium pastilles and the various lozenges containing
opium, etc., the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Pâte Mariani</i> is more agreeable to the taste
and produces anæsthetic and soothing effects." (<cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Gazette des
Hopitaux.</cite>)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<h3><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">PASTILLES</span> MARIANI (COCA AND COCAINE).</h3>

<p>The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Pastilles Mariani</i> are used in the same cases as the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Pâte</i>, from which they differ only by the addition of two
milligrammes of Cocaine hydrochlorate to each pastille.</p>

<p>Their action is much more intense and more rapid than
that of the plain Coca Lozenges.</p>

<p>The paroxysms of cough which are so frequent and so
annoying to those who smoke tobacco to excess, are overcome
as if by enchantment by the use of a few pastilles.</p>

<p>Dose&mdash;Four to eight daily. This amount, however, may
be exceeded, at the discretion of the physicians.</p>


<h3><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">THÉ</span> MARIANI, OR CONCENTRATED EXTRACT
OF COCA (TEA MARIANI).</h3>

<p>As its name indicates, Mariani's concentrated extract of
Coca, or <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Thé Mariani</i>, contains within a small bulk all the
active principles of the Coca leaf. This extract, prepared
in special apparatuses which prevent all alteration and preserve
all its properties and all its aroma, answers entirely
in the various modes of using Coca and constitutes a most
scrupulously exact preparation in dose, the most convenient
and the most active that could be desired.</p>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Thé Mariani</i> is capable of indefinite preservation and easy
of transportation; it renders great service to persons who
make mountain ascensions, fatiguing marches, or long
journeys through unhealthy countries, and in fact in whatever
may be called fatiguing work or pleasure.</p>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Thé Mariani</i> may be taken in the dose of from three to
six teaspoonfuls in the course of the day, clear, or mixed
with brandy, wine, water or milk, etc., hot or cold, in
the latter cases sweetened to taste, if desired.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Coca Tea or Infusion.</span>&mdash;A teaspoonful of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Thé
Mariani</i>, added to a cup of hot water, sweetened to the
taste, with or without the addition of cream or milk, makes
a very agreeable drink, more digestive, more tonic, and
less exciting than coffee or tea, while possessing in a
higher degree the tonic and stimulating properties of
those two substances.</p>

<p>It is in this form that Coca is especially used in Peru and
Bolivia, where it is preferred to the Chinese tea.</p>

<p>Persons who drink Chinese tea at meals may advantageously
substitute the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Thé Mariani</i> for it.</p>

<p>For patients who cannot generally take milk, it is advisable
to add <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Thé Mariani</i>. Excellent results will be
obtained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coca Gargles and Sprays.</span>&mdash;Independently of its tonic
and reconstituent action, Coca possesses anæsthetic and
soothing properties that have been observed and made use
of in practice by laryngologists in the form of a spray, in
the proportion of a teaspoonful of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Thé Mariani</i> to half a
glassful of warm water.</p>

<p>An ambulance physician of Tonkin, who has experimented
with <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Thé Mariani</i>, sends the following note:</p>

<p>"<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Thé Mariani</i> has rendered us real service during expeditions
as well as in hospital practice; on the march it
makes with boiled water, with or without the addition of
sugar, a very agreeable, tonic and stimulating drink; a
veritable reserve food, it takes the place of alcoholic drinks
and insufficiency of food, and aids the men in bearing the
most distressing fatigue. The water of swamps, rivers or
ditches, mixed with a few spoonfuls of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Thé Mariani</i>, could
be drank without any inconvenience, and assuaged thirst.</p>

<p>"<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Thé Mariani</i> stimulates the appetite, overcomes atony
of the digestive organs, and prevents and combats diarrh&oelig;a
efficiently.</p>

<p>"Mixed in small quantity with fresh or condensed
milk, it gives it an agreeable taste and causes it to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>borne by the most delicate stomachs; hence it becomes a
valuable adjuvant in the treatment of the endemic dysenteries
and diarrh&oelig;as of tropical countries.</p>

<p>"Finally, its exclusive use, even its excessive use for
several days, has not seemed to us to exert any injurious
influence on the system, as the abuse of coffee or of
alcoholic drinks had certainly done under like circumstances."</p>

<p>Dr. Fordyce Barker, Dr. J. H. Douglas, Dr. Henry B.
Sands and Dr. Geo. F. Shrady have authorized us to make
known that it was due to <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Thé Mariani</i>, added to milk
(in the proportion of a teaspoonful of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Thé</i> to a cup of
milk), that they were able to nourish Gen. Grant, the ex-President,
when he was unable to support any other food.
By this means they succeeded in prolonging the life of
their illustrious patient for several months.</p>

<p>Coca taken in infusion gave excellent results to Tschudy
while he was sojourning in the valley of the Puna, the
highest in Bolivia, which has given its name to the disease
of mountain sickness, known in Peru by the name <i>Mal de
Puna</i>, also designated by the words <i>sorroche</i>, <i>veta</i> and <i>mareo</i>;
this last term shows clearly enough the analogy which
exists between sea-sickness and the influence of great altitudes
on the human body. Experience has proved the
usefulness of Coca against dyspn&oelig;a and vomiting, so that
the Indians who make ascensions always carry a stock of
Coca with them. Dr. Tschudy found himself comfortable
by the use of it while hunting in those valleys, at a height
of ten to twelve thousand feet above the sea.</p>

<p>Dr. Salemi, of Nice, gives an account of a case of epilepsy
in a woman, 38 years of age, cured by the daily and
prolonged use of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Thé Mariani</i>, given in increasing doses
(ten drops daily at first and eighty drops daily at the end
of a month). This case is not an isolated one.</p>

<h3>IMPORTANT CAUTION.</h3>

<p>Owing to the success obtained by our preparations of
Coca for many years, imitators and counterfeiters have
dared to apply to their own valueless productions the observations
made with our special products. These occurrences,
often repeated, have given rise to protests from
many physicians, among others Dr. W. Oliver Moore, Sir
Morell Mackenzie, Dr. Ch. Fauvel.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

<em>To the Editor of the New York Medical Journal</em>:<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: In your issue of January 3, 1885, page 19, in a report
of a paper read before the New York Medical Society, on
"The Physiological and Therapeutical Effects of the Coca
Leaf and its Alkaloid," occurs the following: "For over
twenty years Dr. Fauvel has used it, both internally in the
form of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i>, and also by local applications to the
pharynx and larynx in spray or by brush, in the form of a
fluid extract, or, more recently, of a concentrated non-alcoholic
preparation more of the nature of a cordial (prepared
by Mariani &amp; Co.)."</p>

<p>Several manufacturers of Coca preparations have taken
occasion to quote from this paper, each in turn substituting
the name of <em>his own</em> production instead of the one mentioned
in the original.</p>

<p>As the preparations of Coca mentioned in my paper were
personally tested and found to be the best of a large number
experimented with, I wish to call attention to these
misquotations and substitutions.</p>

<p class="quotsig">
Very truly,<br />

<p>&#8258; We have taken the trouble to compare the report of
Dr. Moore's remarks with the little book on Coca prepared
by M. Mariani, and with the circulars issued by a number
of manufacturers of Coca preparations; and we certainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>think that some of these manufacturers have taken an unwarrantable
liberty in appropriating work that evidently
cost M. Mariani a good deal of time and no little outlay of
money.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor</span> <cite>N. Y. Medical Journal</cite>.</p>

<p>"In another column we publish a letter from Dr. W.
Oliver Moore, calling attention to an injustice that certain
competing pharmacists have practiced toward Messrs.
Mariani &amp; Co., in 'pirating' published records of the successful
use of the Mariani preparations of Coca, and at the
same time craftily making these records appear to apply to
their own preparations. It is very much to be regretted
that a house that has been so punctilious in avoiding even
the semblance of any offense against the courtesy of trade
should have been treated in this shabby way by some rival
manufacturers."</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>&mdash;Will you kindly have it announced in your journal,
in justice to myself before the medical profession,
that the various notices appearing in journals and circulars
quoting my name in connection with Coca are
entirely false and in every respect a prevarication? The
only preparation of Coca employed by me with undoubted
and uniform success has been the so well-known
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin Mariani</i>, which, since 1865, I have had occasion to
prescribe daily in my <i>clinique</i>, as well as in private practice.
My opinion of this valuable medicament has, during
many years, been frequently made known for the
benefit of the profession in various writings, and it is
but just to this worthy preparation that it receive all
the honor due it. I thank you for compliance with my

<p>Continued compliment is paid M. Mariani for the maintained
high standard and excellence of his preparations,
by the numerous honorable mentions and indorsements by
the members of the medical profession and those who have
occasion to use his Coca preparations; latterly through the
following awards:</p>

<p>Gold Medal and Silver Medal from the <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Académie Nationale
de France</span>; Gold Medal and a Grand Diploma of
Honor from the Wine Exhibit of Bordeaux, France; Gold
Medal and a Diploma of Honor at the Hygienic Exhibit at

at Leamington, England, the jury surnaming his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vin

<p>N. B.&mdash;Professional bicyclists and athletes, after careful
trials of ours and preparations of others, among which the
Cafeine. Theobromine, Kola, pseudo-Cafeine or Kolamine
(Knebel), Maté, etc., invariably give the preference to
our Coca preparation. Messrs. Dubois, Lucas, Vigneaux,
Echalié, André Henry, Imans, Buffel, and many others
have attested to the vast superiority of Coca Mariani over
all other tonics (<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dynamogéniques</span>).</p>

<p>We request those physicians, who kindly place confidence
in our preparations, to prescribe them under the name of

<p>We cannot aim to gain support for our preparation through cheapness; we give a
uniform, effective and honest article, and respectfully ask personal testing of <b>Vin
Mariani</b> strictly on its own merits. Thus the medical profession can judge whether
<b>Vin Mariani</b> is deserving of the unequaled reputation it has earned throughout
the world during more than 30 years.</p>

<p>Inferior, so-called Coca preparations (variable solutions of Cocaine and cheap
wines), which have been proven worthless, even harmful in effect, bring into discredit
and destroy confidence in a valuable drug.</p>

<p><b>We therefore particularly caution to specify always "VIN MARIANI,"
thus we can guarantee invariable satisfaction to physician and patient.</b></p></div>
